4. I am 23 years old and have been attempting to enter the IT world for a while. I started with Python and later 
began learning Swift, but consistently found excuses to avoid continuing my education. However, this year, once again, 
I started exploring a new topic for me, namely web development. I find this direction more appealing as I can track my 
progress and derive motivation from myself, specifically from the projects I work on.
5. HTML
   CSS
   JS
   Figma
   Photoshop
   Blender.
6. const convertText = (text) => {
    if (text === '') {
        return '';
    }
    
    const reversable = text[0] !== text[0].toUpperCase();
    return reversable ? reverse(text) : text;
};

9. My English proficiency is at level A1. I recently moved to Spain, so I am actively learning Spanish at level A2.
